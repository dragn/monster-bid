Genetic Neural Networks. Initial goal was: financial market prediction.

Build with gcc (builds `mbtutor` and `mbtester`):

    $ make

Keep in mind that:

- This software is here only as a showcase of code I've written (some time ago). It does not generally fulfills its task.
- There is basically no documentation, except console programs usage info (any program in bin/ will output usage info if executed without arguments).
- I did not checked that this software compiles anywhere except Linux.
